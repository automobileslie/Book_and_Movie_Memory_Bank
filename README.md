Book and Movie Memory Bank


This application was inspired by some of my experiences planning courses when I was a Philosophy instructor and writing essays as a student. Occasionally, I would end up mining my memory when deciding what to teach, trying to remember the name of a film I saw years ago that would be especially relevant for a particular class. Or, as I was writing I would be reminded of an idea from an essay or book and would rack my brain or have to rummage through my notes trying to find the title of it. The Book and Movie Memory Log is a place to store information about films or books that have made an impact on you, that you know you want to remember and may want to return to for various purposes later on.
